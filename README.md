# ReduxExample
A todo list redux example for react native. Code contains a simple todo list implementation without redux, and a migration of that version which uses redux. 

The starting point of the project is app.js which wraps the internal app (either TodoApp or TodoAppRedux) with a provider to enable interaction with the store.
